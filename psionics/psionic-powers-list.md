# POWER LIST

An ^A^appearing at the end of a power's name in the power lists denotes
an augmentable power. An ^X^denotes a power with an XP component paid by
the manifester.

**Power Chains:** Some powers reference other powers that they are based
upon. Only information in a power later in the power chain that is
different from the base power is covered in the power being described.
Header entries and other information that are the same as the base power
are not repeated. The same holds true for powers that are the
equivalents of spells, only the way the power varies from the spell is
noted, such as power point cost.

**Order of Presentation:** In the power lists and the power descriptions
that follow them, the powers are presented in alphabetical order by
name---except for those belonging to certain power chains and those that
are psionic equivalents of spells. When a power's name begins with
"lesser," "greater," "mass," or a similar kind of qualifier, the power
description is alphabetized under the second word of the power
description instead. When the effect of a power is essentially the same
as that of a spell, the power's name is simply "Psionic" followed by the
name of the spell, and it is alphabetized according to the spell name.

**Manifester Level:** A power's effect often depends on the manifester
level, which is the manifester's psionic class level. A creature with no
classes has a manifester level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise
specified. The word "level" in the power lists always refers to
manifester level.

**Creatures and Characters:** "Creatures" and "characters" are used
synonymously in the power descriptions.

**Augment:** Many powers vary in strength depending on how many power
points you put into them. The more power points you spend, the more
powerful the manifestation. However, you can spend only a total number
of points on a power equal to your manifester level, unless you have an
ability that increases your effective manifester level.

Many powers can be augmented in more than one way. When the Augment
section contains numbered paragraphs, you need to spend power points
separately for each of the numbered options. When a paragraph in the
Augment section begins with "In addition," you gain the indicated
benefit according to how many power points you have already decided to
spend on manifesting the power.
